//An example of generics types available in typescript
const tab = Array<string>();//Here in angle brackets<> we have delcared type of array which is predefined



//Generic Functions, To create our own generic function we have to use same angled brackets <> as ->
function add(a:object, b:object) {
    return Object.assign(a, b);
}
const calledAddFunction = add({name: "Saurav"},{age:24});
//Now this is not allowed, As our type is object and it don't know about name
//console.log(calledAddFunction.name);//To use this we have to use generic here as->
function anotherAdd<T,U>(a:T, b:U) {
    return Object.assign(a, b);
}
const calledAnotherFunction = anotherAdd({name: "Saurav"},{age:24});
console.log(calledAnotherFunction.name);//This is available now
console.log(calledAnotherFunction.age);//This is available too



//Now any type of object can be sent in this function, but if we want to be some restrictive in this
//case, Then we have to use constraints as->
function constraintsFunction<T extends object, U extends object>(a:T, b:U) {
    console.log(typeof a);
    console.log(typeof b);
}
const calledAnotherFunction_1 = anotherAdd({name: "Saurav"}, 30); //As you can see instead of objec we have passed number
//But here it is not allowed because we have used extends constraint on generics
//constraintsFunction({name: "Saurav"},30);



//Same as extends constraint, we have another one to restrict generic with keyof, It is used to indicate that this value on which
//we have used keyof is a key of any object as ->
function keyOfConstraint<T extends object, U extends keyof T>(a:T, b:U) {
    return a[b];
}
console.log(keyOfConstraint({name: "Saurav", lastname: "Pahuja"}, "lastname"));



//Same as generic functions, we can create generic classes as well to use with multiple cases as->
class GenericClass<T> {
    private data: T[] = []; //Used above declared generic here

    addItem(item: T) {
        this.data.push(item);
    }

    removeItem(item: T) {
        this.data.splice(this.data.indexOf(item), 1);
    }

    getItems() {
        return this.data;
    }
}
const obj1 = new GenericClass();
obj1.addItem(35);//We can add number
obj1.addItem("saurav");//We can add string as well, Or any other type
console.log(obj1.getItems());
//To be restrictive, we can pass assign as generic to class as ->
const obj2 = new GenericClass<string>();
//obj2.addItem(34);//Not allowed, Only string is allowed
obj2.addItem("Saurav Pahuja");
console.log(obj2.getItems());
//We can use constraints with classes as well as ->
class GenericWithConstraints<T extends object> {}//Now only with object this class can deal
