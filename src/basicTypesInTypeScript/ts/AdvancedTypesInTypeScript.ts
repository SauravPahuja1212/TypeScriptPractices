//In addition to above if function body has only one statement then we can omit curly braces as ->
const calc = (a:number, b:number) => console.log(a+b);



/**
 * Default function parameters, If we have three arguments in our function and one or more of them are
 * not useful or mandatory to pass everytime by user, Then we can make it default, In case user didn't
 * pass it, One thing to consider that this default property must be the last one in the list of args.

 * Spread operator: This operator is useful when we want to pass values of array and object to 
 * create a single variables with that.

    state: ["Haryana", "Punjab"]
}
const user = {...person}
user.age = 25;
console.log(person, user);
//we could also do this user = person but this way it just creates a reference in memory instead of
//creating a new object. See shallow copy, Deep copy for this concept.

 * accept any number of input variables.
